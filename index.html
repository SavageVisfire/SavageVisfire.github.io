            This bot runs through the rocket league crate algorithim and tells you what you would have gotten if you had opened a crate with a key. This bot is not associated with Psyonix or Rocket League in anyway. You will not recieve the item/items you "win" in-game. This bot was made for fun and can be used to test your luck. You can do crate battles and etc. with this bot.
